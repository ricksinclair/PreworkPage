<!--biography-->

<h2>Some content taken from  the<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Big_L" target="_blank">The Big L Wikipedia Page.</a><br> other content taken  from <a href="https://www.complex.com/music/2014/06/big-l-casualty-of-the-game" target="_blank">a feature complex did on what would have been his 40th birthday. </a>The rest is my own knowledge. </h2>
    <p>Lamont Coleman (May 30, 1974 â€“ February 15, 1999), better known by his stage name Big L, was an American rapper.<br> Coleman is widely regarded as one of the greatest and most lyrical rappers of all time, noted for his use of wordplay.</p>
<br>
<br>
    <p> Damon Dash wanted to sign Lamont to Roc-A-Fella, but Coleman wanted his crew to sign. On February 8, 1999, Coleman, Herb McGruff, C-Town, and Jay-Z started the process to sign with Roc-A-Fella Records as a group called "The Wolfpack". <br> 
    Unfortunately, he was a gunned down on February 15th, 1999 while handing out flyers to announce this life altering news. It was said to be revenge for a plot Big L's older brother Lee conjured up and ordered from prison. Some say he was a completely innocent casualty, others say he involved himself in the plot out of loyalty to his brother. <br>
    In either case, below is an hour-long documentary on his neighborhood and how it ultimately consumed him.
     He was a major influence on a lot of battle rappers in the 90s. A lot of the best all time lyricists knew him and were well aware of his potential.
